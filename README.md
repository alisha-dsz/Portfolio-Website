# Portfolio-Website
A beginner-friendly portfolio website project to apply foundational web development concepts. Built using HTML for structure (headings, paragraphs, images, links), styled with CSS (colors, fonts, spacing, layout), and enhanced with JavaScript for basic interactivity (a button that triggers an alert on click).
